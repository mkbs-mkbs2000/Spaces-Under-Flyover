An interactive map that showcases five flyover locations around the world, where the spaces underneath it have been revitalised for public use. Clicking on a location on the map will focus the viewer to the location, and information on it will also be revealed.

This will eventually be part of a larger online resource guide on how to revitalise neglected spaces under flyovers, with a focus on India and Pune, a city in Maharashtra state. This online resource guide is a final deliverable for a project that is part of the School of Cities' Multidisciplinary Urban Capstone Project.

For now, it will also serve as the Lab 3 submission for GGR472: Developing Web Maps.
