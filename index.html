                            The Bentway is a public multi-use space located under the Gardiner Expressway, between Fort York Boulevard and Fort York Historic National Site.
                            It is most famous for being an ice-skating park during the winter months, but it also serves as a public art gallery, skating park and a venue for various events throughout the year.
                            It is situated within the Fort York neighbourhood in downtown Toronto, and surounded by high-rise residential developments.

                        <h6><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h6>
                        <p>
                            Although there have been intentions to create "a plaza-like area" with "publicly-accessible thoroughfares for pedestrians..., public art... [and] outdoor amenity space" at this specific area since 2004, it was Ken Greenberg, a renowned urban designer and author, who got the ball rolling in 2011.
                            Then, he pitched this idea to urban planner Judy Matthews and her husband Wilmot, an investment banker, who wanted to fund a "legacy project" in the city (Hess & Stevenson-Blythe, 2022).
                            The idea won the support of the city because it was also aligned with the city's aims to enliven the underutilised areas along the elevated portions of Gardiner Expressway (marked in purple in the map), which has long served as a barrier between the main downtown areas to its north and the Waterfront to its south.<br><br>
                            After an initial seed donation of CAD$25 million from Judy and Wilmot, the city announced "Project: Under Gardiner" to revitalise the entire stretch, of which the Bentway is a part.
                            The Bentway was officially opened to the public in January 2018, with about 20,000 people coming to use the space on its opening weekend (Cecco, 2024)

                        <h6><strong>GOVERNANCE AND MAINTENANCE</strong></h6>
                        <p>
                            A City Council report recommended the creation of a new non-profit organisation to manage and finance the day-to-day operations of the Bentway (City of Toronto, 2016).
                            This non-profit organisation, The Bentway Conservancy, was established the following year.
                            The decision to let a private entity, albeit non-profit, to manage a public space that is essentially owned by the city (by virtue of the expressway that runs above it) is made because the city would face serious budget constraints had it been under full municipal jurisdiction.
                            This practice is also in line with numerous other projects done across Toronto, where the city would own the infrastructure but let a separate private entity to run it (Hess & Stevenson-Blythe, 2022).<br><br>
                            Pertaining to funding, the city committed CAD$10 million, to be disbursed over a period of eight years, to the Bentway Conservancy.
                            The city also empowers the Bentway Conservancy to seek alternative funding sources such as sponsorships, donations and collecting fees from nearby businesses through Business Improvement Association.<br><br>
                            This conservancy model has proven successful because the Bentway remains a well-attended space seven years after its opening. 
                            The Conservancy is also appointed as partners with the city to realise "Project: Under Gardiner", which has since been rebranded as <a target="_blank" href="https://undergardinerprp.ca/">Under Gardiner Public Realm Plan</a>.
